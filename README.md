# Protonup-rs

CLI program to automate the installation and update of Proton-GE

> **NOTE**: This is not nearly as feature complete as the original Protonup.
> I've create it because the original project had a few issues with its Python dependencies (that most liekly got fixed already), and I wanted to try to re-create it in rust.
> If this repo becomes ever gets to a stable state, I will publish it to Cargo and other repositories.

## Usage

Clone repo

```bash
cd protonup-rs
cargo run --release
```
